Active Transport Options for New Developments

This project will provide evidence for local authorities, developers and civil society groups to support planning and investment in sustainable transport infrastructure that enables trips to new developments to be made by active modes, walking and cycling.
It will deliver three main things: evidence on the current level of provision for walking and cycling; evidence on the potential for likely trips to and from the new developments to be made by walking and cycling (including cycling potential to major trip attractors such as cities centres and cycling potential to public transport links); and visualisations of the options available to improve provision.
