Active Transport Options for New Developments

This project will provide evidence for local authorities, developers and civil society groups to support planning and investment in sustainable transport infrastructure that enables trips to new developments to be made by active modes, walking and cycling.
It will deliver three main things: evidence on the current level of provision for walking and cycling; evidence on the potential for likely trips to and from the new developments to be made by walking and cycling (including cycling potential to major trip attractors such as cities centres and cycling potential to public transport links); and visualisations of the options available to improve provision.



Current level of provision:

- First we need to identify the locations of developments we are researching. Basic info - date built, number of homes. Focus on the larger developments - 500+ homes? 
- scoping exercise on nature of OSM data. Is the development mapped? Compare Mastermap v OSM, to validate the OSM data. 
- routability validation. Quality of new data can vary. We must be sure data is topographically correct. Are nodes connected. Keepright visual check.
- identify destinations. Shops, schools, health centres, major employment centres, town centres, rail/bus nodes?
- compare provision within the development with beyond the development boundary, when accessing key destinations.
- compare crow fly v on-road routes
- cycle/walk v road route times
- severance of routes (eg by major roads)
- quality of the provision. Categorise cycle infrastructure. In OSM we can see whether cycleways are separate from traffic/pedestrians, the width etc. We can categorise into 8 classes. Cycling states. 
- walking routes - how to categorise the quality of these.

Potential for cycling and walking:

- this would assess optimal cycling and walking from development locations, based on their location in regard to the destinations we have already identified. 
- fastest route on CycleStreets, but also look at crow fly distances because new developments are often full of 
- difference between quiet and fast routes. See http://www.makingspaceforcycling.org/#principles
- model cycle potential as a function of time taken to cycle v time taken to drive
- for many developments (the ones that tend to represent urban sprawl) the two key areas for improvement may be improvements to major roads to allow cycling/walking, and the creation of new links that don't exist at present.

Options available to improve provision:

- this can be used to generate automated suggestions for innovations
- identify the new links that should be added 
- identify the existing streets that should be improved and how they should be improved
- assess what difference this would make for cycling/walking uptake

Outputs and Outcomes

We will generate clean data on cycling and walking provision and potential.
Create prototype map visualising this data.
A report setting out the policy impact - potentially a peer-reviewed paper.
