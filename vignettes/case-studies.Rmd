## Leeds



### Planning applications

Using data from [PlanIt](https://www.planit.org.uk/), we have identified four recent planning applications with approval for >100 homes. 

Allerton Bywater Millennium Community:

- one of a series of Millennium Communities, the development at Allerton Bywater was announced by John Prescott in 1998. The homes lie on the site of Allerton Colliery, which was the last remaining colliery in Leeds when it closed in 1995. The aim was to incorporate the whole of Allerton Bywater village in the project, rather than solely focusing on the site itself. For example, a £500,000 community fund was made available to the parish council to spend on local projects, and community buildings in the village were also refurbished. In total there was £24 million upfront public investment by English Partnerships and the HCA. This included drainage, site clearance and decontamination. The development incorporates high environmental standards for both the homes and the new industrial units, and a number of homes built under a 'Design for Manufacture' competition for a construction cost of no more than £60,000.

- in total there are 562 homes in the Millennium Community. The final phase includes 189 homes and has planning consent 13/05235/FU. A sustrans cycle route passes through the site, which is designed as a HomeZone with shared space streets, although these tend to fill up with parked cars. However, plans for buses to be routed through the site did not materialise. The village lies eight miles southeast of Leeds and the buses to Leeds run every 30 minutes, as well as more frequent services to Garforth and Castleford. 

Leeds Climate Innovation District:

- situated on the banks of the River Aire, close to Leeds city centre, the Climate Innovation District is being developed by Leeds-based firm Citu. The development is built around high environmental standards including low carbon timber-framed homes with high levels of insulation and a Mechanical Ventilation Heat Recovery System preventing the need for gas central heating. The homes will be served by solar panels on-site via a private-wire network; a Community Interest Company will be set up that will own the utility cooperative. 

- a new foot/cycle bridge has been erected over the River Aire to connect the two halves of the site and allow a traffic-free route into the city centre. On-site car parking is in an undercroft; these spaces have to be purchased at a cost of £15,000. Cycle parking is available on-site.

- in total there will be over 520 new homes. Phase 1 to the north of the river will contain 312 dwellings, with planning consent 15/00415/FU. 

Micklefield:

- planning consent 15/01973/FU is for a development of 292 residential dwellings by house builders Barratt Homes and Persimmon Homes on greenfield land in the village of Micklefield, nine miles east of Leeds. 

- the site does not fully meet the Leeds Core Strategy Accessibility Standards. There are bus stops nearby but the services are infrequent, with only an hourly service increasing to two an hour at peak times. However, Micklefield station allows access to Leeds city centre with a 20 minute journey time. The S106 agreement includes £8000 for improved cycle facilities at the station. It also mandates 15% affordable housing, of which 60% is for social rent.

Tyersal:

- planning consent 15/04151/FU was gained in April 2016 for a 270 dwelling development on a greenfield site at Tysersal Lane by developer Gleeson Homes. Although the site lies within ths bounds of Leeds it is actually closer to Bradford, and the only road access is to west, via the Bradford suburb of Holme Wood. Regular buses to Bradford city centre pass by the edge of the site. The proposed parking provision is approximately two spaces per dwelling. 

- the site does not fully meet the Leeds Core Strategy Accessibility Standards. A viability assessment was accepted, stating that the scheme could not provide all of the usual planning gain contributions (S106 monies), with no affordable homes due to be built on site. This is subject on ongoing review. Gleeson's state that their homes are priced at a level so that they can be afforded by 90% of local people in full time employment.

### Accessibility indicators

Journey time statistics (JTS) are available from the Department for Transport recording accessibility at the geographical level of the LSOA (an area covering approximately 1500 residents or 650 households). The statistics include average minimum travel times to key local services and destinations, such as town centres, centres of employment, primary schools, secondary schools, food stores and GP surgeries. 

Travel times are calculated for three modes of travel - by car, by cycle, and by a mode that combines walking and public transport.

The LSOA zones in Leeds are shown below, together with their working age population. LSOA population should normally be relatively constant, but it is considerably higher in some Leeds LSOAs. This may be due to new residential developments (especially student accommodation) built after the LSOA boundaries were set.  

```{r}
# library(dplyr)
# work_accesibility = get_jts_data(table = "jts0501", year = 2017)
# jts_0501_metadata = get_jts_data(table = "jts0501", year = "Metadata")
# # View(jts_0501_metadata)
# wy_zones = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "west-yorkshire", geography = "lsoa")
# # names(work_accesibility)
# names(work_accesibility)[1] = names(wy_zones)[1]
# zones = dplyr::left_join(wy_zones, work_accesibility)
# zones_leeds = zones %>% filter(lad_name == "Leeds")
# plot(zones_leeds["100EmpPTt"])
# plot(zones_leeds["Empl_pop"])
# plot(zones_leeds$all, zones_leeds$Empl_pop)
# sf::write_sf(zones_leeds, "zones_leeds_pct_jts_2017_lsoa.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_upload("zones_leeds_pct_jts_2017_lsoa.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_download_url("zones_leeds_pct_jts_2017_lsoa.geojson")
zones_leeds = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/cyipt/acton/releases/download/0.0.1/zones_leeds_pct_jts_2017_lsoa.geojson")
qtm(zones_leeds, "Empl_pop")
```

The JTS record travel times from the population weighted centroid of each LSOA. New housing developments can be constructed anywhere within an LSOA, and may not necessarily be close to existing homes. To assess the accessibility of new developments we therefore use statistics that relate to the closest LSOA centroid. For our Tyersal Lane case study site, the closest LSOA centroid is in Bradford.

Multiple statistics are available for access to centres of employment, including travel time to locations with 100-499 jobs, to locations with 500-4999 jobs, and to locations with 5000+ jobs. We have combined these three statistics to produce a single measure weighted by the number of jobs.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/73770519-7997ee80-4774-11ea-9a3a-fb100bc405f7.png")
```

We have then combined the weighted access to employment measure with the measures for access to food stores, town centres, primary schools, secondary schools and GPs. By adding together all of these scores we have generated a single accessibility statistic for each mode of travel. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52210872/73870615-52105700-4844-11ea-850a-3065ab05da7a.png")
```

According to DfT's JTS, there are many areas that have poor accessibility by active modes and public transport. 

## Route busyness

```{r}
library(stplanr)
od_from_zone1 = data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE,
  origin = zones_leeds$geo_code[1],
  destination = zones_leeds$geo_code[2:9]
)
desire_lines = od2line(flow = od_from_zone1, zones_leeds)
plot(desire_lines)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
routes_fastest = route(
  l = desire_lines,
  route_fun = cyclestreets::journey,
  plan = "fastest" # on CRAN version only fastest works
  )
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# save roues_fastest object
saveRDS(routes_fastest, "routes_fastest.Rds")
piggyback::pb_upload("routes_fastest.Rds")
piggyback::pb_download_url("routes_fastest.Rds")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
routes_fastest = readRDS(url("https://github.com/cyipt/acton/releases/download/0.0.1/routes_fastest.Rds"))
```


```{r plot-fast-routes}
routes_fastest$busyness = routes_fastest$busynance / routes_fastest$distances
plot(routes_fastest["busyness"])
```
