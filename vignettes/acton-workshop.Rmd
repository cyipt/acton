**Two developments in the case study data for Leeds, illustrating differences in provision for active transport**

The objectives are to:

1. Get attendees up-to-speed on progress, and plan the next stages of work

2. To get opinions on how to ensure the project can have wider impact and provide useful outputs

3. To consider how ACTON can contribute to future projects

4. To make progress on ACTON with a focussed coding session tackling problems such as barriers, route severance, and options to improve site accessibility

## Agenda

## Intro and overview (10:00 - 10:30)

- overview of ACTON project
- go round with intro to interest in the project and what they hope to get out of it
- local policy and planning considerations

## Data and methods (10:30 - 11:30)

(This will include discussion of progress and expected next steps)

- Talk on input data and API access from CycleStreets.net (20 minutes)
  - improvements to PlanIt. How can we best enable the automation and filtering of planning application searches?
  - journey routing for cycling - progress on CycleStreets routing algorithm for ‘quiet’ journeys
- Findings from case study sites by Joey Talbot (20 minutes)
  - accessibility and journey time statistics
  - busyness of route segments
  - barriers and severance
- Discussion (20 minutes)
  - comparison of route quality/circuitousness for different modes of travel
  - selection of options for improving accessibility of case study sites

**Break**

## Outputs (11:45 - 12:15)

- Overview of outputs so far by Robin Lovelace (15 minutes)
- Discussion of what stakeholders need and would like from the project, including from
  - web service / tool
  - the final report
  - journal article
  - media coverage
  - R package
  - website

## Links with Future work (12:15 - 13:00)

Group discussion with feedback after 30 minutes

- what benefits can ACTON provide for future stages of CyIPT or related projects?
- how can methods be generalised from case study sites to move towards a nationwide tool?
- how do we make sure the project is useful for a wider audience?
- what areas for further development are people interested in?

**Lunch**

## Hackathon (14:00 - 16:00)

In this section, for developers, we will go in depth and work on the code for some of the topics discussed above, including:

- methods for estimating severance and identifying key links to overcome severance
- journey routing for walking – test out using OpenTripPlanner
- integrating the outputs of the ACTON project into other tools such as CyIPT and planning tools
- estimating travel to major trip attractors
- addressing key limitations of the data
