## Introduction

The ACTON Workshop will take place on Friday 13th March, starting 10:00.

The objectives are to:

1. Get attendees up-to-speed on progress, and plan the next stages of work

2. To get opinions on how to ensure the project can have wider impact and provide useful outputs

3. To consider how ACTON can contribute to future projects

4. To make progress on ACTON with a focussed coding session tackling problems such as barriers, route severance, and options to improve site accessibility

## Agenda

## Intro and overview (10:00 - 10:30)

- overview of ACTON project
- go round, everyone briefly introduce their interest in the project / what they’ve been working on and what they want to get done next

## Data and methods (10:30 - 11:00)

(This will include discussion of progress and what we need to get done by end of the project.)

- improvements to PlanIt. How can we best enable the automation and filtering of planning application searches?
- journey routing for cycling - progress on CycleStreets routing algorithm for ‘quiet’ journeys
- journey routing for walking – test out using OpenTripPlanner
- case study sites
- accessibility and journey time statistics
- busyness of route segments
- barriers and severance
- comparison of route quality/circuitousness for different modes of travel
- selection of options for improving accessibility of case study sites

**Break**

## Outputs (11:15 - 12:15)

- what outputs do we want to see and what is the progress on these? Such as:
- report
- journal article
- media coverage
- R package
- website

## Links with Future work (12:15 - 13:00)

- what benefits can ACTON provide for future stages of CyIPT or related projects?
- how can methods be generalised from case study sites to move towards a nationwide tool?
- how do we make sure the project is useful for a wider audience?
- what areas for further development are people interested in?

**Lunch**

## Hackathon (14:00 - 16:00)

In this section, for developers, we will go in depth and work on the code for some of the topics discussed above, including:

- Methods for estimating severance and identifying key links to overcome severance
- Integrating the outputs of the ACTON project into other tools such as CyIPT and planning tools
- Estimating travel to major trip attractors
- Addressing key limitations of the data
