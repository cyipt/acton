## Hackathon (14:00 - 16:00)

In this section, for developers, we will go in depth and work on the code for some of the topics discussed above, including:

- methods for estimating severance and identifying key links to overcome severance
- journey routing for walking – test out using OpenTripPlanner
- integrating the outputs of the ACTON project into other tools such as CyIPT and planning tools
- estimating travel to major trip attractors
- sketching a user interface to access ACTON data via a webtool, inspired by and building on https://www.streetfocus.uk/

# Local policy and planning considerations by **David Ellis, WSP**


---

## Policy requirements (10:25 - 11:00)

--

- How to improve active transport provision around new developments: a policy perspective by **Ray Georgeson** (10 minutes)

--

- Panel discussion of needs and wants for tools for integrating active transport in new developments (25 minutes)

--

Panelists:

Elizabeth Barner

Ray Georgeson

John Townsend

Roger Geffen

--

Questions:

- What are the limitations of existing tools and processes that are designed to support active transport in / around new developments?
- What are the most important factors preventing people who move into or who work at new developments from getting there by active modes?
- What would your dream tool for active transport planning look like?!

---

## Data and methods (11:20 - 12:15)

(This will include discussion of progress and expected next steps)

- Talk on input data and API access from **CycleStreets.net** (20 minutes)
  - improvements to PlanIt
  - journey routing for cycling - progress on CycleStreets routing algorithm for ‘quiet’ journeys
- Findings from case study sites by **Joey Talbot** (15 minutes)
  - accessibility and journey time statistics
  - busyness of route segments
  - barriers and severance
- Spatial network analysis approaches for walkability by **Crispin Cooper** (20 minutes)

---

## Next steps (12:15 - 13:00)

- Overview of outputs so far and next steps by **Robin Lovelace** (10 minutes)

<!-- What's possible and not possible with current data and technology -->

- Discussion in small groups of 3-5 (15 minutes)
  - which outputs from the project will be most useful to you?
  - what additional features/data would you like to see in future work?
  - how do we make sure the project is useful for a wider audience?
  - what areas for further development are people most interested in?

<!-- - how can methods be generalised from case study sites to move towards a nationwide tool? -->
<!-- - what benefits can ACTON provide for future stages of CyIPT or related projects? -->
- Feedback from Groups (10 minutes)
- Individual feedback on tool (10 minutes)
